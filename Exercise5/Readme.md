# AutoCAD ObjectARX Application - Adding Layer Functionality

## Overview

This ObjectARX application introduces the `addLayer` function, designed to manage the presence of a layer named "OBJ" within the current AutoCAD drawing. Should the "OBJ" layer be absent, the function dynamically creates it, configuring specific properties as required.

## Functionality

The `addLayer` function executes the following operations:

1. **Verify Existing Layer:**

   - Scans the Layer Table to confirm the existence of a layer named "OBJ."

2. **Generate New Layer if Absent:**

   - In the event of non-existence, the function proceeds to:

     - Access the Layer Table for modification.

     - Generate a new AcDbLayerTableRecord to represent the "OBJ" layer.

     - Define the layer's name as "OBJ" and its color as cyan.

     - Incorporate the fresh layer into the Layer Table.

     - Conclude by closing both the Layer Table and the created layer record to release resources.

## Usage

1. **Compilation and Loading:**

   - Initiate the ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio.

   - Compile the project and load the ensuing DLL within AutoCAD.

2. **Executing the Command:**

   - Within AutoCAD, invoke the designated custom command tied to the `addLayer` function (e.g., "ADDLAYER").

3. **Observing Outcomes:**

   - Witness the function's execution, ensuring the presence of a "OBJ" layer within the drawing, complete with specified properties if necessary.
