# Debugging Setup - ObjectARX Project

## Overview

This guide details the process of configuring and setting up the ObjectARX project for debugging within Visual Studio. Debugging enables developers to analyze program behavior, examine variables, and address issues efficiently during the development phase.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Generating Debug Version:

   - Compile a debug version of the ObjectARX project within Visual Studio.

### 2. Configuring Project Properties:

   - Launch the ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
   - Adjust project properties to facilitate debugging.

### 3. Modifying Debugging Settings:

   - Customize settings within the project properties to activate debugging functionality, including compiler and linker options.

### 4. Placing Breakpoints:

   - Position breakpoints within the code at specific locations where you wish the debugger to pause execution for inspection purposes.

## Usage

1. **Compiling Debug Version:**
   - Open the ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
   - Compile the debug version of the project.

2. **Configuring Project for Debugging:**
   - Modify project properties to support debugging, incorporating compiler and linker options tailored for debugging.

3. **Adjusting Debugging Settings:**
   - Fine-tune debugging configurations within the project properties to align with your development requirements.

4. **Setting Breakpoints:**
   - Identify critical junctures within your code where variable inspection or step-by-step execution is necessary.
   - Place breakpoints at these specific locations.

5. **Executing in Debug Mode:**
   - Launch the ObjectARX project in debug mode via Visual Studio.

6. **Inspecting Variables:**
   - Upon encountering a breakpoint, utilize the debugger to scrutinize variable values, traverse through the code, and analyze program flow.
