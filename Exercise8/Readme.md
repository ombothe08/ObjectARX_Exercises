   - Iterates through the selected objects, adjusting their colors as per the user's input.
   - Users can specify colors using keywords ("Red," "Yellow," "Green") or numeric values (1, 2, 3).
   - If the user selects "Bylayer," the object's color defaults to the layer color.

4. **Closure of Selected Objects:**
   - Concludes by closing the selected objects post-color modification.
