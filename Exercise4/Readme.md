# AutoCAD ObjectARX Application - Add Line
 
## Overview
 
This ObjectARX application defines a function called `addLine` that efficiently inserts a straight line into the current drawing's Model Space using the ObjectARX API. The function takes care of proper resource handling, ensuring efficient memory management.
 
## Functionality
 
The `addLine` function accomplishes the following tasks:
 
1. **Retrieve the Current Database:**
   - Obtains a pointer to the current drawing's database.
 
2. **Open the Block Table in Read-Only Mode:**
   - Allows read-only access to the Block Table, which stores information about blocks within the drawing.
 
3. **Get the Model Space Block Reference:**
   - Retrieves the Block Table Record corresponding to the Model Space, where drawing entities are typically located.
 
4. **Define Start and End Points for the Line:**
   - Specifies the 3D coordinates for the starting and ending points of the new line.
 
5. **Create a New Line Entity:**
   - Allocates memory for a new AcDbLine object, representing a straight line entity in AutoCAD.
 
6. **Append the Line to Model Space:**
   - Adds the newly created line object to the Model Space Block Table Record, effectively placing the line in the drawing.
 
7. **Close the Model Space Block Reference:**
   - Finalizes the Model Space Block Table Record, ensuring proper resource management.
 
8. **Release Resources Associated with the New Line:**
   - Frees memory and other resources used by the newly created line object.
 
## Usage
 
1. **Build and Load:**
   - Open the ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
   - Build the project and load the resulting DLL in AutoCAD.
 
2. **Execute the Command:**
   - In AutoCAD, enter the custom command linked to the `addLine` function.
 
3. **Observe Results:**
   - The function will insert a straight line into the Model Space of the current drawing.
